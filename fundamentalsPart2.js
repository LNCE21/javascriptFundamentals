/*STRICT MODE
//Example, if we make an intentional error we will see how the console on the browser will show us where is the error.
let hasDriversLicense = false;
const passTest = true;
if(passTest) hasDriversLicense = true;
if (hasDriversLicense) console.log("I can drive :D");
*/



/*FUNCTIONS
//Example of logger function, a function that logs into the console.

//Syntax: function keyword, name of function, ();, next follows the curly braces, all the code inside them are part of the "function body" and its the code that will be executed every time we call the function.
function logger() {
    console.log("My name is Lautaro");
}

//Invoking/running/calling the function, we simply write the name with ();
logger();


//Example of function with parameters, return
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
    const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges.`;
    return juice;
} 


//Invoke, call, run the function fruitProcessor by adding arguments (the values of the parameters)
const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
console.log(appleJuice);

//Invoke, call, run the function fruitProcessor by adding a different arguments
const appleOrangeJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 4);
console.log(appleOrangeJuice);

//Another example of a function is the Number function, is a built-in function, we pass a string as s parameter and returns a number:
Number("23");

//Another example of a function is the console.log function, it is another built-in function were we pass*/




/*FUNCTION DECLARATIONS VS. EXPRESSIONS
//In JavaScript, functions are like values, meaning that they can be stored in variables. 

//Example Function Declaration to calculate age on a given birth year. We can actually call function declarations before they are defined in the code, even if itâ€™s not a good idea.
function calcAge1(birthYear) {
    return 2022 - birthYear;
}
const age1 = calcAge1(1993);
console.log(age1);

//Example Function Expression: As all the expressions, it produces a value. So, we write the function without a name but instead, we store the value on a variable. The main difference is that we cannot call the function before its define, it forces you to keep a nice structure (define all the functions first at the top of the code, and only then call them):
const calcAge2 = function (birthYear) {
    return 2022 -birthYear;
}
const age2 = calcAge2(1993);
console.log(age2);
*/



/*ARROW FUNCTIONS  
It is a special form of function expression that is shorter, and therefore faster to write. It's called arrow function because its part of the syntax:

//Example of arrow function to calculate the age:
const calcAge3 = birthYear => 2022 - birthYear;
//Calling the function
const age3 = calcAge3(1993);
//Log in the console.
console.log(age3);


//Example how many years left until retirement, we need more than one line of code, and for that matter we are going to need return:
const yearsUntilRetirement = birthYear => {
    const age = 2022 - birthYear;
    const retirement = 65 - age;
    return retirement;
}
//Calling the function
console.log(yearsUntilRetirement(1993));


//Example arrow function with more than one parameter:
const yearsUntilRetirement = (birthYear, firstName) => {
    const age = 2022 - birthYear;
    const retirement = 65 - age;
    return `${firstName} retires in ${retirement} years.`;
}
//Calling the function by passing arguments
console.log(yearsUntilRetirement(1993, "Lautaro"));
*/




/*FUNCTIONS CALLING OTHER FUNCTIONS

//Example of function calling other functions. One function will process the fruits into small pieces. The other one, will recieve a pieces of apples and oranges, and next, produces and return juice.

//This function cuts the fruit in 4 pieces and returns the value.
function cutFruitPieces(fruit) {
    return fruit * 4;
}
//This function of the fruit processor will cut the received apples and oranges in 4 pieces. To achieve this we need to call the function from above -cutFruitPieces- inside the function fruitProcessor:
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
    const applePieces = cutFruitPieces(apples);
    const orangePieces = cutFruitPieces(oranges);
    const juice = `Juice with ${applePieces} pieces of apples and ${orangePieces} pieces of oranges.`;
    return juice;
} 
//Calling the fruitProcessor function with the arguments 2 and 3 and logg to the console.
console.log(fruitProcessor(2, 3));
*/




/*REVIEWING FUNCTIONS
//Example remaking an arrow function:
const calcAge = function(birthYear){
    return 2022 - birthYear;
}
//Main function calling the above function
const yearsUntilRetirement = function (birthYear, firstName) {
    const age = calcAge(birthYear);
    const retirement = 65 - age;

    if(retirement > 0) {
        return `${firstName} retires in ${retirement} years.`;
    }   else {
        return `${firstName} has already retired.` 
    }
}
//Calling the function
console.log(yearsUntilRetirement(1993, "Lautaro"));


function calcAge(birthYear, firstName) {
    const age = 2022 - birthYear;
    console.log(`${firstName} is ${age} years old.`);
    return age;
}

const age = calcAge(1993, "Lautaro");*/




/*INTRODUCTION TO ARRAYS
//Store a name in a variable to use later:
const friend1 = "Michael";
const friend2 = "Steven";
const friend3 = "Peter";
//Now, lets recreate the same but with arrays:
const friends = ["Michael", "Steven", "Peter"];
console.log(friends);
//Another way of writing arrays, with the array function:
const year = new Array(1991, 1984, 2008, 2020);

//Now lets console the first element of the -friends- array
console.log(friends[0]); //Arrays are zero based, here we indicate the index

//.length property to know the number of elements in the array, or to select the last element without knowing how many elements are inside:
//To know the length
console.log(friends.length);
//To select the last element, because there are x time of elements, but the first one starts on position 0.
console.log(friends[friends.length - 1]); 

//Add elements into the array, using index position:
friends[2] = "Jay";

//We can calculate something, because JavaScript expects an expression always:
const lautaro = ["Lautaro", "Clerici", "Erhardt", 2022 - 1993, "developer", friends];
console.log(lautaro);


//Remake of the calcAge function, but with arrays:
const calcAge = function(birthYear){
    return 2022 - birthYear;
}
//Array of birth years:
const years = [1990, 1967, 2002, 2010, 2018];
//Use the calcAge function and then store the results of calculating the first, second and last ages in a new array:
const age1 = calcAge(years[0]);
const age2 = calcAge(years[1]);
const age3 = calcAge(years[years.length - 1]);
console.log(age1, age2, age3);
//Remake of the previous function calls -calcAge(years[0])- into one single array
const ages = [calcAge(years[0]),calcAge(years[1]),calcAge(years[years.length - 1])];
console.log(ages);
*/




/*BASIC ARRAY OPERATIONS (METHODS)
//Example of an array:
const friends = ["Michael", "Steven", "Peter"];

//METHODS TO ADD ELEMENTS: PUSH (back) AND UNSHIFT (front)
//PUSH METHOD, is a function that we call that is attached to the friends array itself, we pass an argument to the function and we use it to add the element to the array. Push method returns the length of the new array:
const newLengthPush = friends.push("Jay");
console.log(friends);
//Push method returns length of new array, we can capture the value storing in a new variable, like we did on the example above: newLength
console.log(newLengthPush);
//UNSHIFT METHOD, function to add an element to the beginning of an array:
const newLengthUnshift = friends.unshift("John");
console.log(friends);
//Unshift method returns length of new array, we can capture the value storing in a new variable, like we did on the example above: newLengthUnshift
console.log(newLengthUnshift);

//METHODS TO REMOVE ELEMENTS: POP (back)
//POP METHOD, removes the last element of the array, in this case we don't pass any argument because is no needed to take the last element. 
const newLengthPop = friends.pop();
console.log(friends); //Jay is gone from the array
//Pop method returns the removed element, if we capture the value on a new variable like we did on the example above: newLengthPop
console.log(newLengthPop);
//SHIFT METHOD, Removes the first element of the array, in this case we don't pass any argument because is no needed to take the first element:
const newLengthShift = friends.shift();
console.log(friends); //John is gone from the array.
//Shift method returns the removed element, if we capture the value on a new variable like we did on the example above: newLengthShift
console.log(newLengthShift);

//METHODS TO GET THE POSITION OF AN ELEMENT
//INDEXOF,tells us the position of an element in the array
console.log(friends.indexOf("Steven"));//Returns the index 1
//INCLUDES,  returns true if the element if the element is in the array and false if it is not. Uses strict equality operator to the comparisonl:
console.log(friends.includes("Pedro"));//Returns false
//Another application of .includes is for conditionals:
if (friends.includes("Peter")) {
    console.log("You have a friend called Peter");
}
