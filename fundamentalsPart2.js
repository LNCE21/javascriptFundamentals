/*STRICT MODE
//Example, if we make an intentional error we will see how the console on the browser will show us where is the error.
let hasDriversLicense = false;
const passTest = true;
if(passTest) hasDriversLicense = true;
if (hasDriversLicense) console.log("I can drive :D");
*/



/*FUNCTIONS
//Example of logger function, a function that logs into the console.

//Syntax: function keyword, name of function, ();, next follows the curly braces, all the code inside them are part of the "function body" and its the code that will be executed every time we call the function.
function logger() {
    console.log("My name is Lautaro");
}

//Invoking/running/calling the function, we simply write the name with ();
logger();


//Example of function with parameters, return
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
    const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges.`;
    return juice;
} 


//Invoke, call, run the function fruitProcessor by adding arguments (the values of the parameters)
const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
console.log(appleJuice);

//Invoke, call, run the function fruitProcessor by adding a different arguments
const appleOrangeJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 4);
console.log(appleOrangeJuice);

//Another example of a function is the Number function, is a built-in function, we pass a string as s parameter and returns a number:
Number("23");

//Another example of a function is the console.log function, it is another built-in function were we pass*/




/*FUNCTION DECLARATIONS VS. EXPRESSIONS
//In JavaScript, functions are like values, meaning that they can be stored in variables. 

//Example Function Declaration to calculate age on a given birth year. We can actually call function declarations before they are defined in the code, even if itâ€™s not a good idea.
function calcAge1(birthYear) {
    return 2022 - birthYear;
}
const age1 = calcAge1(1993);
console.log(age1);

//Example Function Expression: As all the expressions, it produces a value. So, we write the function without a name but instead, we store the value on a variable. The main difference is that we cannot call the function before its define, it forces you to keep a nice structure (define all the functions first at the top of the code, and only then call them):
const calcAge2 = function (birthYear) {
    return 2022 -birthYear;
}
const age2 = calcAge2(1993);
console.log(age2);
*/



/*ARROW FUNCTIONS  
It is a special form of function expression that is shorter, and therefore faster to write. It's called arrow function because its part of the syntax:*/

//Example of arrow function to calculate the age:
const calcAge3 = birthYear => 2022 - birthYear;
//Calling the function
const age3 = calcAge3(1993);
//Log in the console.
console.log(age3);
