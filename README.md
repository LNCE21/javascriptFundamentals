### Instructions

#### There is one assignment for each lecture in the JavaScript Fundamentals Sections Part 1 and 2 (not all lectures, but most);

#### The goal of these assignments is that you can immediately apply the concepts you learn in each video;

#### So after you complete each lecture, find the assignment for the video you just watched, and write the code according to the instructions;

#### In order to actually write the code, create a new script called assignments.js in the current project folder and link it to the HTML file we have been using, just like we previously linked script.js (an HTML file can include multiple JavaScript scripts). The console will now show outputs from both script.js and assignments.js
