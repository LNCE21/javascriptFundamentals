## Instructions

<p align="left">There is one assignment for each lecture in the JavaScript Fundamentals Sections Part 1 and 2 (not all lectures, but most); 
<br>
The goal of these assignments is that you can immediately apply the concepts you learn in each video;
<br>
So after you complete each lecture, find the assignment for the video you just watched, and write the code according to the instructions;
<br>
Finally, on each section you will find challenges and projects to practice even further.
