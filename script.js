/* Operators


// Math operators
let now = 2021;
const ageJonas = now - 1991;
const ageSarah = now - 2018;
console.log(ageJonas, ageSarah);
console.log(ageJonas * 2, ageJonas / 10, 2 ** 3);
//2 ** 3 --> Means 2 to the power of 3 --> 2*2*2

// Plus operator to concatenate strings
const firstName = "Jonas ";
const lastName = "Schmedtmann";
console.log(firstName + lastName);

// Assignment operators
let x = 10 + 5;
console.log(x);
x += 10; // Means x = x + 10
console.log(x); 
x *= 4;  // Means x = x * 4
x ++ //Means x + 1

// Comparison operators
// <  > =  >=  <= 
console.log(ageJonas > ageSarah); 
console.log(ageSarah >= 18);
*/

/*Operator Precedence
console.log(now- 1991 > now - 2018);
//both parts are resolved before the comparison operator of the middle, because it has more precedence.

//The result is 10 because is a Left to right exectution
//console.log(25 - 10 - 5);

//Assignments are a right to left exectution
let x, y; //Here I am declaring 2 empty variables
x = y = 25 - 10- 5; // Subtraction operator has more precedence, so it's executed from left to right. And after that, assignments are executed from right to left, that's why y is assigned first.
console.log(x, y); //x and y are both 10
