/*TYPE CONVERSION & TYPE COERCION

/*Type conversion
Example -Conversion String to Number- the wrong way. 
Imagine we have an input string, it won't sum 18 to 1991, it will concatenate a number at the end of the string:*/
/*
const inputYear = "1991";
console.log(inputYear + 18); //Result on console: 199118
*/

//Example -Conversion String to Number- with Number function. To fix this error from above and be able to sum 18 to 1991 we need to convert this string into a number with the Number function
/*
const inputYear = "1991"; //This keeps being a string
console.log(inputYear + 18); 
console.log(Number(inputYear) + 18); //This gives us a converted version
*/

//Example -Conversion Number to String- with String function.
/*
console.log(String(1991) + inputYear);//Conversion of 1991 to string
*/

//NaN error: Not a Number is the result that appears on the console whenever an operation that involves numbers fails to produce a new number. Not a Number means "invalid number"
/*
console.log(Number("Jonas")); //Jonas can't be converted to a number
*/

/*Type coercion
console.log("I'am " + 23 + " years old");//Plus operator converts numbers to strings
console.log("23" - "10" - 3); //Minus operator converts strings to numbers
console.log("23" * "2");//Multiplier and divider converts strings to numbers
console.log("23" > "18"); //Logical converts strings to numbers

//Exercise 1:
let n = "1" + 1; //Type Coercion converts 1 to string so = 11(string)
n = n - 1; //Type Coercion converts 11string to number so = 10(number)
console.log(n); //Result, 10 number
//Exercise 2:
let m = 2 + 3 + 4; //Sums every number = 9
m = m + "5"; //Type Coercion converts 9 to string and concatenates 5 = 95
console.log(m);//Result 95 string

/*TRUTHY AND FALSY VALUES 
//Here we write some examples of them

console.log(Boolean(undefined));//Falsy
console.log(Boolean("Jonas")); //String, Truthy
console.log(Boolean({}));//Empty object, true
console.log(Boolean(""));//Empty string Falsy

//Example 1: when we have a logical context (if else), JavaScript will apply Typed Coercion and will convert the value so that can execute the code. But, in this case 0 can't be transformed into a boolean, so it will be "falsy" or in other words "false"
const money = 0;
if (money) {
    console.log("Don't spend it all!")
